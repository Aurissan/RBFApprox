# RBFApprox
A Python program for function approximation and interpolation using RBF-ANN, made as a part of my bachelor's thesis project at MUCTR
# Known issues
*The alternative RBF-ANN described in [the following paper](https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=36536584) (Russian) does not work unless the input data is presented as a cartesian product of the individual inputs
# To-Do
-[] Translate the UI to English
-[] Rewrite the UI
-[] Find a way for the alternarive RBF-ANN to work with any data
-[] Fix bugs
